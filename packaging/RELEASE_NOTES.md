## What's new

- **Mac: GPU acceleration.** On a Mac (Apple Silicon and Intel) the picture is now developed on the GPU through Metal instead of the processor. If Metal cannot be used, the plug-in falls back to the processor by itself. Tested on GitHub's Apple Silicon machines, where the GPU's picture matches the processor's; not yet tried inside DaVinci Resolve on a Mac, so reports are welcome in the issue tracker.
- Windows and Linux: unchanged.
